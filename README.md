# UFOs

## Overview of the project
Dana is a data journalist who is given the opportunity to write about her hometown McMinnville, Oregon. 
McMinnville is famous for its UFO sightings and also has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts.
Dana wants our help to put everything together into a web page with an article and a table of data to support her findings.
Moreover, we need to convert the data to html table which can be easily filtered for date, city, state, country and shape using javascript.

## Results
* We have build a webpage on UFO sightings and deployed it on a github page [UFO Sightsing](https://cryptotwister.github.io/UFOs/).
